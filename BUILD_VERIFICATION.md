# Build and ESLint Configuration Verification

This document verifies that all build fixes and ESLint/TypeScript configurations mentioned in the deployment requirements are correctly implemented.

## Verification Date
October 8, 2025

## Items Verified

### 1. ESLint Configuration ✅
**Location:** `apps/web/.eslintrc.json`

**Expected Configuration:**
```json
{
  "extends": ["next/core-web-vitals", "next/typescript"]
}
```

**Actual Configuration:**
```json
{
  "extends": [
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "next/typescript"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars": [
      "warn",
      {
        "argsIgnorePattern": "^_",
        "varsIgnorePattern": "^_"
      }
    ],
    "react/no-unescaped-entities": "warn"
  }
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - Extends the required Next.js ESLint configurations with additional custom rules for unused variables.

**Test Result:**
```bash
cd apps/web && yarn lint
✅ Passes with only minor warnings (unused variables, unescaped quotes)
```

---

### 2. Next.js Configuration ✅
**Location:** `apps/web/next.config.js`

**Requirement:** Remove `experimental.serverActions` option (deprecated in Next.js 14+)

**Actual Configuration:**
```javascript
const nextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ['@jacameno/shared', '@jacameno/ui'],
  // Server Actions are enabled by default in Next.js 14
  // experimental.serverActions config is no longer needed
  images: {
    domains: ['jacameno-music.s3.amazonaws.com'],
  },
  // ... other config
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - The deprecated `experimental.serverActions` option has been removed.

---

### 3. TSX File Syntax ✅
**Locations:**
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/streaming/page.tsx`
- `apps/web/src/app/studio/page.tsx`

**Requirement:** All TSX files should use correct JSX/TSX syntax.

**Test Result:**
```bash
cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit
✅ Passes with no errors
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - All TypeScript and JSX syntax is valid.

---

### 4. Peer Dependency Warnings ⚠️
**Warnings Observed:**
```
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-web@0.19.13" has unmet peer dependency "react-dom@^18.0.0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-reanimated@3.3.0" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/plugin-proposal-nullish-coalescing-operator@^7.0.0-0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-reanimated@3.3.0" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/plugin-proposal-optional-chaining@^7.0.0-0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-reanimated@3.3.0" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/plugin-transform-arrow-functions@^7.0.0-0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-reanimated@3.3.0" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/plugin-transform-shorthand-properties@^7.0.0-0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native-reanimated@3.3.0" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/plugin-transform-template-literals@^7.0.0-0"
warning "@jacameno/mobile > react-native > @react-native/codegen@0.72.8" has unmet peer dependency "@babel/preset-env@^7.1.6"
```

**Status:** ⚠️ **EXPECTED AND SAFE TO IGNORE**

**Explanation:**
These warnings originate from the `@jacameno/mobile` workspace, which contains React Native dependencies. According to the project's DEPLOYMENT.md documentation:

> "For web deployments (Next.js), these are **safe to ignore** as React Native mobile dependencies are not used in the web build"
> "Do not add mobile-specific peer dependencies to the web app"

The web app (`@jacameno/web`) already has its own `react-dom@^18.2.0` dependency in `apps/web/package.json`.

**Action:** ❌ **DO NOT ADD** these dependencies to the web app. They are mobile-specific and would bloat the web bundle unnecessarily.

---

### 5. Workspace Configuration ✅
**Location:** Root `package.json`

**Requirement:** Must have `"private": true` for Yarn workspaces to function.

**Actual Configuration:**
```json
{
  "name": "jacameno-music",
  "private": true,
  "workspaces": [
    "apps/*",
    "packages/*",
    "services/*"
  ]
}
```

**Status:** ✅ **CORRECT** - The private field is present.

---

## Build Test Results

### Lint Test
```bash
cd apps/web && yarn lint
✅ SUCCESS - Only minor warnings about unused variables
```

### TypeScript Check
```bash
cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit
✅ SUCCESS - No type errors
```

### Build Test
```bash
cd apps/web && yarn build
⚠️ EXPECTED FAILURE - Cannot access fonts.googleapis.com due to network restrictions in CI environment
```

**Note:** The build failure is expected in CI environments with restricted network access. This is documented in DEPLOYMENT.md and does not affect actual Vercel deployments which have proper network access.

---

## Summary

All required build fixes and configurations are correctly implemented:

1. ✅ ESLint configuration uses Next.js plugin with TypeScript support
2. ✅ Next.js configuration does not have deprecated options
3. ✅ All TSX files have valid syntax
4. ⚠️ Peer dependency warnings are expected and safe to ignore
5. ✅ Root package.json has required private field

**Conclusion:** The repository is correctly configured for Next.js web deployment. No changes are needed.
