## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables for API keys and credentials
2. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update npm and pip packages
3. **Validate input**: Always sanitize and validate user input
4. **Use HTTPS**: Enable SSL/TLS in production
5. **Implement rate limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse
6. **Use strong authentication**: Implement secure JWT handling

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords**: Minimum 8 characters with mixed case, numbers, and symbols
2. **Keep software updated**: Always use the latest version
3. **Protect API keys**: Never share your API keys publicly
4. **Enable 2FA**: When available, enable two-factor authentication
5. **Review permissions**: Be cautious when granting app permissions

## Known Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: Store all API keys in environment variables, never in code
2. **JWT Tokens**: Use strong secrets and appropriate expiration times
3. **File Uploads**: Validate file types and sizes to prevent malicious uploads
4. **Database**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
5. **CORS**: Configure CORS to allow only trusted domains in production
